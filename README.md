colorcoded

"colorcoded" is a color identification iOS app offering several tools (i.e. color search) that provides users a way to visualize different colors and its view relevant color data. Colorcoded uses a database containing approximately 3.6 million identified colors, with ongoing additions. Colorcoded also provides a unique way to interact with color using the onboard camera system on iOS devices.
